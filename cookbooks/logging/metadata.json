  "long_description": "# RightScale Logging Cookbook\n\n## DESCRIPTION:\n\nThis cookbook is available at [https://github.com/rightscale/rightscale_cookbooks](https://github.com/rightscale/rightscale_cookbooks).\n\nThis cookbook provides a set of recipes used by the RightScale\nServerTemplates to configure the logging service provider.\n\nThis cookbook configures the default logging provider installed on the image.\nIf a remote server is defined it will configure an instance to send its\nlog messages to the specified remote server based on its FQDN or IP address.\nIf a remote server is not defined, the default configuration is used, which\nsaves the log files locally on the instance.\n\n## REQUIREMENTS:\n\n* Must be used with a 'logging' provider in the cookbook path\n* Requires a virtual machine launched from a RightScale-managed RightImage.\n\n## COOKBOOKS DEPENDENCIES:\n\nPlease see `metadata.rb` file for the latest dependencies.\n\n* `rightscale`\n* `logging_rsyslog`\n* `logging_syslog_ng`\n\n## KNOWN LIMITATIONS:\n\n* Currently only supports the logging provider installed on the image:\n  rsyslog or syslog-ng\n* Cookbook supports client configuration for a single remote server using\n  several protocols.\n* Requires customer maintained remote server for remote logging.\n\n## SETUP:\n\n* Place `logging::default` recipe into your runlist to setup the logging\n  resource. When using a RightScale ServerTemplate, this will also automatically\n  configure logging service provider (rsyslog/syslog-ng). If a remote server is\n  specified the default  recipe will determine the logging provider installed\n  (rsyslog/syslog-ng) and configure it for remote logging.\n* To setup a logging server, place the following recipes in order to your\n  runlist:\n\n    logging_<provider>::setup_server\n      sets up the logging provider.\n\n    logging::install_server\n      sets up generic server inputs and configures a logging server.\n\n  For example: To set up and install an rsyslog logging server\n\n    logging_rsyslog::setup_server\n    logging::install_server\n\n## USAGE:\n\n1. Local Logging - Set the 'logging/remote_server' input to 'ignore' to use\n   the default configuration installed.\n2. Remote Logging - Set the 'logging/remote_server' input to the FQDN or IP of\n   the designated remote logging server to adjust the default configuration to\n   the remote logging configuration.\n3. Transfer protocol - Set the 'logging/protocol' input to one of the listed\n   options:\n   1. UDP: the most generic and common-used option. UDP is the default logging\n      protocol option.\n   2. RELP: RELP stands for Reliable Event Logging Protocol.\n      RELP ensures that no message is lost, not even when connections break and\n      a peer becomes unavailable.\n   3. RELP-secured: while using RELP to ensure a safe and loss-free transmission\n      between two machines the traffic also gets encrypted with an SSL\n      certificate the user should provide with the 'logging/certificate' input.\n      As stunnel is configured with the \"verify = 3\" option the server would\n      require and verify the client certificate against the locally installed\n      certificate providing client authentication.\n\n## DETAILS:\n\n### General\n\nThe 'logging' interface is defined by a Lightweight Resource, which can be found\nin the `resources/default.rb` file.\n\nThis cookbook is intended as a framework for logging providers. The current\nimplementation supports the minimum configuration for rsyslog and syslog-ng.\n\nNote: This cookbook does not modify the installed logging provider.\n\nFor more information about Lightweight Resources and Providers (LWRPs), please\nsee: [Lightweight Resources and Providers][LWRP]\n\n[LWRP]: http://support.rightscale.com/12-Guides/Chef_Cookbooks_Developer_Guide/04-Developer/06-Development_Resources/Lightweight_Resources_and_Providers_(LWRP)\n\n### Providers:\n\nThe current implementation does not support providers other than rsyslog and\nsyslog-ng.\n\n### Custom Configuration:\n\nThe default settings can be customized by replacing the default configuration\ntemplate for the provider. For more information, please see:\n[Customize a Chef-based ServerTemplate](http://support.rightscale.com/12-Guides/Chef_Cookbooks_Developer_Guide/04-Developer/ServerTemplate_Development/02-Customize_a_Chef-based_ServerTemplate)\n\n## LICENSE:\n\nCopyright RightScale, Inc.
